# WODReader
Scraps Bion Crossfit website for wods and displays workout for the current day

# Next Steps
Add a tick-over time which tells the program when to display wods for the next day.

# Update 6/17/20
Changed to list of search strings.  
Program now checks for multiple formats of the possible webpage.
Only have two formats for non-split week and one for split week currently but plan to add more as encountered.
